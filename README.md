Code for physics-enhanced remaining-useful-life of second-life lithium-ion batteries

The repository contains:

• Code for RUL Prediction/Cluster*_model.ipynb – reproducible training and inference notebooks for the three usage clusters identified in the study.

• Code for Simulation/ – scripts that generate the physics-based simulation data used to enrich the data‐driven model.

• Code for figures/ – utilities for recreating all manuscript figures from the saved results.

• results_all.mat – aggregated numerical outputs reported in the paper.

Running the notebooks from top to bottom will reproduce the main results and figures reported in the manuscript.
